# Readable - V2

Readable is a content and comment web app that was developed by using React and Material UI. Users will be able to post content to 3 predefined categories (redux, react or udacity), comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This project was [initially](https://github.com/lcnogueira/react-readable-project) developed as a part of the Udacity's React course. However, I decided to create a new version of it on my own, in order to use better solutions that I have learned through bootcamp and **to achieve the unform challenge** by Rocketseat.

## How to start the app

1. Install and run the API server:

```
cd backend
yarn install
yarn start
```

2. After running the API server, install and run the frontend web app. **In the root folder**:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```
